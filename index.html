        <h1>Alexander Mondero</h1>
        <p><em><strong>Real Estate Agent with <a href="https://www.allcityhomes.com/">All City Homes</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>When Alexander Mondero was handed the keys to his very first home, he knew he would one day want to help others experience the same type of happiness. In 2014, Alex earned his real estate license and now gets to see that joy all the time
          with his own clients.<br>
          <br>
          Serving the Greater Sacramento Area with All City Homes, Alex has worked with everyone from first-time home buyers, retirees, and investors to his own friends and family. He understands that buying and selling a home is one of the biggest
          financial decisions a person can make and that the process itself can be quite daunting. However, his guidance, dedication, and perseverance when working with his clients make it all worthwhile—not to mention the enjoyment he gets from it.<br>
          <br>
          Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, Alex attended the College of San Mateo. He then moved to Sacramento in 2000, where he eventually transferred to California State University at Sacramento. He credits his past career in customer
          service
          and technical support at AT&T for helping him develop the listening and problem-solving skills that benefit his relationship with his real estate clients. Alex is committed to making people’s dreams of owning a home a reality.<br>
          <br>
          Alex has two children with his wife, Jaclyn. When he’s not working, he loves spending time with his family, golfing, and cheering on the Bay Area’s Giants, 49ers, and Warriors.
